      <title>Distortion Fields in OpenSCAD: Computationally Expensive And Not Entirely Satisfying, But Good To Know Anyway</title>

      <description>This is the second in an occasional series about 3D models and prints that I design. The code for this post, and some 3D models, are available in the associated github repo. The code for this post was largely inspired by the bending procedures posted to Thingiverse by the user flavius
In the previous post, I described how to use the children module in OpenSCAD to repeat models in regular patterns&amp;ndash;specifically, to make cylindrical tiled vase sculptures.</description>

      <description>This is the first in what I expect to be an occasional series about 3D models and prints that I design. The code for this post, and some 3D models, are available in the associated github repo.
If you get into 3D printing, it&amp;rsquo;s almost inevitable that you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually print a vase. Vases are in a particular sweet spot&amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re sculptural, architectural, and potentially intricate, but with very few structural requirements.</description>
